2. Script Viruses
Write a script virus for a script language of your choice, e.g., bash or Python. By definition,
the virus needs to propagate itself by infecting other scripts. Once these other scripts are
run, they propagate the virus further.
Follow these guidelines for simplicity and security.
(a) Create a new directory, VIRUS, and only work on the virus in this directory.
(b) Make two subdirectories of VIRUS, one is called scripts, the other src.
(c) Generate a few simple scripts in the scripts directory in the scripting language that
you want your virus to propagate in. For example, write a couple of “Hello World”
scripts, and one slightly more complex script. Also crate a regular text file, a binary
executable program, and a script of another language.
(d) Develop your virus in the src directory. Call your virus virus.
(e) For simplicity and security, limit your virus to only infect files that are in the same
directory as the virus itself.
(f) To test your virus, always make a copy of the directory scripts called test and
then copy the virus from src to test as well. In unix, you can make such copies as
follows:
cp -a scripts test/
cp src/virus test/
